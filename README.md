# Exploring Webhooks
I'm trying to find out more about webhooks and created this space so that I could explore the data that gets returned from webhooks. I may expand it to write my own webhook and send that off somewhere else.

#### Approach
My idea here is to create a simple web page that will display the content of the webhook data sent to it.

I will launch this on Heroku so that the url will always be available to the places I give the url to. This way I can check in on it and see what's happening.

At first I'll just have it display the most recent item sent to it and display the raw data alongside a prettified version of it. I have thoughts on expanding it to store the information on a database.
